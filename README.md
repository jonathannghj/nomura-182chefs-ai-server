# nomura-182chefs-ai-server

Welcome to the Nomura 182 Chefs API Server repository! This server powers the Nomura 182 Chefs AI modeling through RESTful API endpoints built with FastAPI for the Nomura AI Trailblazer Hackathon. 

The AI model uses advanced forecasting, natural language processing, as well as multi-objective optimisation modelling to create optimal trade investment trade recommendations. It was deployed on AWS EC2 during the competition, and has since been taken down ever since.
